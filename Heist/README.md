# Hack The Box: Heist machine write-up

This is a windows box thoroughly based on enumeration, it starts with a guest access that leaks some credentials followed by smb users enumeration that provides us with even more users. Then winRM is enabled, so we can access the box using those creds. Finally, a search for strings from the firefox process leaks even more credentials giving us full access to the box as admin.

Let's dig in! The IP of the machine is ``10.10.10.149`` and I added it to my `/etc/hosts` file as `heist.htb`.

### Enumeration

As always, we start by enumerating open ports to discover the services running in the machine. I fire up nmap:

*Result of initial nmap scan*

```sh
# Nmap 7.70 scan initiated Mon Aug 19 14:47:18 2019 as: nmap -v -sV -sC -oN nmap/initial heist.htb

```

Okay so we see that we'll need to enumerate smb shares and also check the web server. I also ran another nmap scan on the background to check all ports (`nmap -v -p- -sV -sC -oN nmap/all heist.htb`) and something interesting came up:

*Result of exhaustive nmap scan*

```sh
5985/tcp  open  http          Microsoft HTTPAPI httpd 2.0 (SSDP/UPnP)
|_http-server-header: Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0
|_http-title: Not Found
```

Looks like winRM is enabled! WinRM is a Windows-native protocol used to administer machines remotely that has been known to have some serious flags that allow authenticated RCE.

#### Port 80 enumeration

Upon visiting the webserver we have a log in panel. However, there is an option to log in as guest, which leads us to a chat between `Hazard` and a system administrator that contains an interesting file as attachment.

The file attached is a config file from a router and contains different credentials:

```

I cracked two of the hashes with <http://www.ifm.net.nz/cookbooks/passwordcracker.html>:

*Hash 1*

*Hash 2*

The other one, `$1$pdQG$o8nrSzsGXeaduXrjlvKc91` was an md5 hash and I cracked it with John The Ripper to obtain `stealth1agent`.

Good, so far we have three possible credential sets:

```
Users: Rout3r, admin, Hazard
Passwords: $uperP@ssword, Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d, stealth1agent
```

#### SMB enumeration

I then tried to access any shares through SMB. Trying credentials with smbmap I got the right ones: `Hazard:stealth1agent`. However, there was nothing interesting on `IPC$` and the other two shares were not accesible.

*smbmap output*

I then tried to obtain more possible users by using `lookupsid.py` from impacket. And good! I obtained two more users: `Jason` and `Chase`!

#### Getting user with winRM

I cloned a ruby tool called `evil-winrm` from github (<https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrms>):

*Github page of evil-winrm*

I started trying combinations of credentials until I found the right one and was prompted with a shell, although then I found out that there was a metasploit module that did this automatically for you. Well, too bad.

The credentials were: `chase:Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d`.

*Gaining a shell as user and getting the hash*

### Privilege escalation

I tried to run some enumeration powershell scripts but apparently the user `chase` didn't have many permissions. One thing I could do was list processes on the machine, so I ran `get-process` and found out firefox was running, which is not common on HackTheBox boxes.

*Listing processes*

I then searched for the string `password` on the user's directory recursively which would give me anything (if there was) that firefox stored on disk. And turn out there was! I used the following command: `Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\ -Recurse -File | Select-String password`

*Getting the admin password*

Then I just used it with `Administrator` on the winrm script and had full privileges!

*Getting to root*

Overall, I think this is a good machine for windows beginner, maybe a bit too based on users enumeration (I got really frustrated at some points). I hope you found the writeup useful, if you liked it you can give me respect on hackthebox through the following link: <https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/31531>.
