# Hack The Box: FriendZone machine write-up

Although this machine was rated as easy with 20 points, I found it really challenging and learnt a great deal in some aspects, like DNS. It starts with us checking smb, getting some credentials and then having to do a zone transfer in order to find an admin panel, after which we come across an LFI which leads to RCE. Then, it's just a matter of realising that there is a cronjob running a python script as root which imports the """os""" library, so we can poison it and hence get to root.

The machine runs with ip 10.10.10.123.

## Enumeration

First, I enumerate open ports to discover the services running in the machine:

```sh
nmap -sV -sC -oA nmap/initial 10.10.10.123
```

```console
# Nmap 7.70 scan initiated Thu Feb 14 08:48:29 2019 as: nmap -sV -sC -oA nmap/initial friendzone
Nmap scan report for friendzone (10.10.10.123)

```

So many things, so let's go one by one.

### SMB server

I connected anonymously to the samba shares and discovered some interesting credentials. For that, I used SMBMap, a useful tool which lets the user scan all shares, list them recursively and even download files:

![Img](images/smb1.png "Img")

![Img](images/smb2.png "Img")

I tried to use the credentials in FTP and SSH, but no luck.
Therefore, I decided to move on to the webserver on port 80.

### Web server on port 80

The main page looked like this:

![Img](images/web80.png "Img")

I tried to run dirbuster and came across what was a rabbit hole: a directory called ```wordpress``` that was empty. I tried to have a look at port 445, but nothing came up. It was time to enumerate port 53!

### DNS enumeration

I was completely new to this so I was advised to watch Ippsec's video of Bank (kudos to him). It indeed turned out to be useful, as the technique was the same: Zone Transfer. What this attack does is the following: the attacker acts as if it were a slave DNS server and asks the server for DNS entries, to which the compromised server complies. Hence, the attacker gets a bunch of useful information data.

The command I used was:

```
dig axfr @10.10.10.123 friendzone.red
```

I used that domain because in the main page there was an email with domain ``friendzoneportal.red`` and, after trying with that and getting nothing I removed the ``portal`` substring.

![Img](images/dig.png "Img")

We can see some interesting domains, amongst which there is one that contains administrator! I added all of them to my ``/etc/hosts`` file.

### Web server on port 445

After adding all the entries, I visited ``https://administrator1.friendzone.red/``.

![Img](images/web445_1.png "Img")

I entered the creds obtained through SMB: ``admin:WORKWORKHhallelujah@#``.

![Img](images/web445_2.png "Img")

![Img](images/web445_3.png "Img")

![Img](images/web445_4.png "Img")

After some enumeration with dirbuster I dsicovered a PHP script called timestamp in that directory, so that gave me a clue of what was really happening: the ``pagename`` parameter includes a PHP script, in this case ``timestamp.php``.

## Getting user

With that in mind, it's easy to guess what to do: I just need to upload a PHP script to SMB (Development share) and then try to include it in the ``pagename`` parameter. Simple, isn't it?

Well, it didn't turn out to be that easy, as I couldn't find the path of ``Development``... After quite a lot of time, someone gave me a hint and told me to look at ``/etc/``. And there is was! I made a simple PHP file called ``test.php`` and uploaded to ``Development``. The contents of the file were:

```php
<?php echo "YESSSSS";?>
```

Then I accessed it with ``/etc/Development/test`` as the ``pagename`` parameter.

![Img](images/test.png "Img")

Okay, so now I just needed to upload a shell and listen with netcat!

![Img](images/rev.png "Img")

And we get the user hash being ``www-data``: ``a9ed20acecd6c5b6b52f474e15ae9a11``.

## Getting root

I started to enumerate the system and came across two interesting facts:

* There is a python script in ``/opt/server-status/reporter.py``:

```py
#!/usr/bin/python

import os

to_address = "admin1@friendzone.com"
from_address = "admin2@friendzone.com"

print "[+] Trying to send email to %s"%to_address

#command = ''' mailsend -to admin2@friendzone.com -from admin1@friendzone.com -ssl -port 465 -auth -smtp smtp.gmail.co-sub scheduled results email +cc +bc -v -user you -pass "PAPAP"'''

#os.system(command)

# I need to edit the script later
# Sam ~ python developer
```

* The ``/usr/lib/python2.7/os.py`` file could be edited!

I then used ``pspy``, a tool to monitor processes without the need of root privileges and got the following cronjob:

![Img](images/pspy.png "Img")

Okay, so we have a python script that runs as root in a cronjob, and this script import os, which we can write. Seems obvious right? It's only necessary to poison the library by modifying the source code of ``/usr/lib/python2.7/os.py``.

I run the following command:

```console
echo "system('chmod 777 -R /root')" >> /usr/lib/python2.7/os.py
```

I waited and voil√†! I could now access the root directory and read the flag:

![Img](images/root_dir.png "Img")

And finally we can do ``cat root.txt``:

```
b0e6c60b82cf96e9855ac1656a9e90c7
```

Definitely one of the most interesting and learning-wise machines I've ever rooted! I hope you learnt as well reading the write-up!
